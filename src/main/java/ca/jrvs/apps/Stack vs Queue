Difference between stack and queue:

1) Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out) whereas QUEUE is FIFO (First In First Out)
2) Stack uses push() and pop() which is usedd to add and retrieve elements from stack.
Queue uses offer() and poll() which is used to add and remove object.
3) Elements/objects are added at the top of the stack. Elements/objects are enqueued at different end, either head or tail.
4) Stack data structure is recursive data structure. Queue data structure is sequential data structure.
